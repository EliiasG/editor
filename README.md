# Editor for 2D vector graphics games
I recently made a [drawing app](https://github.com/EliiasG/MonoGameDrawingApp) for vector graphics, now i want to make an editor for games that use those graphics.
### Planned features:
- [ ] Game setup - Will allow the programmer to define different types that can be set up by a designer using the editor- (a bit like unity ScriptableObjects or godot Resources, but should allow easier mod support)
- [ ] Animations - how animations work is defined [here](https://github.com/EliiasG/MonoGameDrawingApp/blob/main/Animations.md)
